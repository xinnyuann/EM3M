## EM3M
Python implementation of the Expectation-Maximization on Mixture of Markov Model (EM3M). 

### Use Cases
- Web Analytics - study customer's behavior on the platform, navigation data, identify some UX improvements, or for attribution analysis
- Customer Journey Analysis - cluster and aggregate individual behaviors into a small number of representative customer journey
